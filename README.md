# Accelerated CoffeeScript

This code covers maybe 80% of what every CoffeeScript programmer should know. The exercises are taken from the book: CoffeeScript, Accelerated JavaScript Development

* use it as a refresher, if you already know CoffeeScript, read each source file to explore how CoffeeScript works, and optionally look at the generated JavaScript, though even this is not necessary if you grok the CoffeeScript properly.
* if you're new to CoffeeScript, you can study the CoffeeScript, and compare it to the paired JavaScript output to see how CoffeeScript translates to JavaScript
* coding the CoffeeScript and compiling it yourself is the best way to get practical, and should take maybe an hour to go through all the code here and grok CoffeeScript
